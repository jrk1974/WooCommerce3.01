# WooCommerce3.00 - 3.02
Cannot Calculate Shipping Charges when the Billing Address is set as the default.  Charges are only calculated after a shipping address is entered.  This requires a customer to key both the billing and shipping address, even if they are the same.
Prior to version 3.00, 3.01 and 3.02 the calculations worked fine with a billing address only.
